# alan-assistant
Alan is a terminal based assistant written primarily for the Linux Operating System. He is known to help with multiple regular tasks and much more. This is a hobby project, not production ready. Unless the community wants it to be.

I will be working on this on the weekends or whenever time allows, community is free to chime in and raise Issues/PR.
