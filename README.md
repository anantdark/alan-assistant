# FAQ

- Writing FAQ when your code is bare?<br>
This project will stretch and I don't want it lost in the crowd, the FAQ section is very underrated, it helps someone who just landed on the repository get all the information he needs quickly. I swear by it whenever I visit any repository.

- Explain about the project a bit?<br>
alan-assistant as evident by the name is an assistant for linux based OS. It is not an "AI" assistant, so you need to give/choose specific commands for it to execute, but it can be used to save some time, idk. Like set a reminder, or convert currency/time zones, etc. Essentially it is a mush of various programs for python.

- What is the project Structure?<br>
_Project Structure_? Well not sure about that, don't we just start writing in a python file? <br>NO?. Ok so I have little to no experience in software design and all that stuff, I do have knowledge of functional programming and some basics but that's all, so if you know something I don't, enlighten me.

- Programs like this are scattered over github, why are you making another one?<br>
Nothing just as a hobby/learning experience. Sure this is not an original idea _duh_. But the way I see it, the implementations on github don't come close to what I have envisioned and instead of modifying their code I am choosing to start fresh.

- Why do you even need it, using the terminal/native apps is faster?<br>
Maybe it is, maybe it isn't we can't say for sure. But I am tired of making aliases in my bashrc, time to put it all on this.

- Will it have voice recognition and all that stuff?<br>
Nope, never. I don't like that, it will have CLI based interface (GUI is overrated), you will have the option to select from a set of pre-defined tasks the assistant is capable of performing, and the task will be done simple as that.

- Seems a bit complex, you sure you are up for it?<br>
As I mentioned, it is a hobby project of mine, so I never expect it to be complete, I just want to work on it in peace and hopefully someone can use my program and go _wow_.

- How can I contribute?<br>
Welcome, this is my first large scale project so IDK you tell me.<br> I will be updating the issues and other stuff as I get time, but if you can think if any enhancement or can solve some problem, go ahead.
